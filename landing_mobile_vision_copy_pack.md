# Landing Page Expansion Pack (Mobile + Vision)

Goal: present **current capabilities first**, then show **Mobile** and **Vision** as near-term roadmap.
Avoid claiming unavailable features as guaranteed.

## 1) Recommended Landing Sections

1. Hero (current value)
2. How it works (3-step)
3. Proof / Demo (existing screenshots, live link)
4. Current features
5. Mobile roadmap
6. Vision roadmap
7. Pricing / CTA / Footer

> Place roadmap sections after proven value sections to avoid over-promising.

## 2) Mobile Roadmap Copy

### Section title options
- Built for mobile-first trading review.
- Log faster when your alert fires.
- Move review from chart to your pocket.

### Copy
When an alert fires, let users jump from notification to chart, tap a candle, collect opinion, and save a note in one flow.

### Planned mobile capabilities
- One-click alert-to-review entry.
- Bubble create/edit/search.
- AI opinion quick mode.
- Recent n-day offline review cache.

## 3) Vision Section

### Title options
- Turn review into measurable assets.
- Capture evidence, reduce emotion-driven mistakes.
