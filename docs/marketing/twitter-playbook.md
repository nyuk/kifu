# Twitter(X) Operating Guide (v1.0-first)

Goal: run a steady two-week content routine as a solo operator.

## 1) Account setup (one-time)

- Short, memorable handle.
- Bio draft:
  `KIFU | Trading review platform with Bubble notes, AI opinions, and chart replay.`
- Link: GitHub or live demo.
- Pin: core project intro + GitHub link.

## 2) Publishing rules

1. Publish learning-oriented posts, not spam.
2. Use 1 feature + 1 insight + 1 CTA per thread.
3. Include at least one real screenshot or metric.
4. Keep v1.1 items in appendix only.

## 3) Frequency (first 14 days)

- Tue / Thu / Sat (example schedule)
- 1 post per day, total 6 posts/week
- Weekend: monitor responses only

## 4) Automation vs manual

Recommended: semi-automated.
- AI drafts only.
- Human approves content, links, and sensitive details.
- Scheduled publishing by your workflow tool.

Reason: trust and quality matter more than speed in finance tooling.

## 5) Queue workflow

Use `docs/marketing/x-post-queue.sample.json`.

### Queue statuses
- `draft`: AI drafted and pending review
- `approved`: ready for publish
- `platform`: always `x`

### Publishing cadence
1. New feature done: 1 development log.
2. +2 days: 1 screen/UI post.
3. +7 days: 1 learning post.
