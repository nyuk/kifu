# Summary Pack v1.0 View: System Overview

v1.0 covers full review workflow, journaling, and AI opinion comparison.
v1.1 only automates run selection for summary pack generation.

## v1.0 objectives

1. Collect trade/portfolio/bubble events and preserve context.
2. Compare AI opinion and market outcomes.
3. Provide review-first tabbed workflows and clear progress signals.

## v1.0 main screens

- `/home`: daily summary, review entry points, quick metrics
- `/portfolio`: positions and allocation views
- `/chart`: candle + bubble + replay integration
- `/trades`: trade history and summary
- `/review`: review notes, accuracy tabs, and outcome summaries
- `/alerts`: alert and briefing systems

## Core data pipeline

1. Exchange sync / CSV import / manual position input
2. Bubble creation and persistence
3. AI opinion collection per event
4. AI note storage and user review notes
5. Outcome and accuracy calculation

## v1.0 review loop

- Guided/structured flow across intent, emotion, pattern, and memo
- No-trade day handling
- Calendar/accuracy/trend analysis for repeat behavior
- Replay and past-point comparison in chart context

## Operational safety (v1.0)

- Retry and quota guardrails for AI
- Position and trade consistency checks
- Cross-tab KPI consistency checks

## v1.0 vs v1.1 split

- v1.0: explicit source run or manual pack flow.
- v1.1: auto-select latest eligible completed run and return structured `pack_id`.
- NotebookLM responses should keep v1.1 as appendix.
